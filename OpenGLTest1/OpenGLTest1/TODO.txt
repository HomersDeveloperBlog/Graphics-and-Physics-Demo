TODO:

Next build:
Need to connect the physical object to stored mesh data
Need to connect our scene drawing to the physical object mesh data

Later:
Place our meshes model space and our physical objects in world space.
Render onto screen space using CPU code.

Graphics: Full vertex shader. Textures. Lighting. Shadows.
Physics: Something interesting.

Eventually:
Shader compilation code is pretty bad. Loading from file would be nice.
Connecting the mesh input to some 3D object database. Then a non-procedural mesh could be used.
Accurate convex hull computations from display mesh. (boost::geometry)
Accurate inertia computations from convex hull. (Some published formula)
