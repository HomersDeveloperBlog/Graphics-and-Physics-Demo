TODO:
Refactor physics. graphics need 3D double data, currently 2D float.
Scene needs camera. Uniform locations stored in scene.
View / Projection matrix creation code. GL mat4 conversion.
New shader code with transformation uniforms.
Physics code with proper odeint type requirements fulfilled.

Later:
A way to apply forces/torques to the object. Reduces to force-contact point.

Graphics: Textures. Lighting. Shadows.
Physics: Something interesting.
Interactivity: Trackball rotation

Maybe eventually:
Refactor include structure.
Connecting the mesh input to some 3D object database.
Accurate convex hull computations from display mesh. (boost::geometry)
Accurate inertia computations from convex hull. (Some published formula)
