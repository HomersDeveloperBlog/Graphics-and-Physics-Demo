TODO:
Refactor physics, graphics (3D data, currently 2D).
Render onto screen space using CPU code.
The same thing with OGL uniforms.

Later:
A way to apply forces/torques to the object. Reduces to force-contact point.

Graphics: Textures. Lighting. Shadows.
Physics: Something interesting.
Interactivity: Trackball rotation

Eventually:
Shader compilation code is pretty bad. Loading from file would be nice.
Connecting the mesh input to some 3D object database.
Accurate convex hull computations from display mesh. (boost::geometry)
Accurate inertia computations from convex hull. (Some published formula)
